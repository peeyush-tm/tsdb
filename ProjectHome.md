# TSDB #

TSDB is a Python module for storing large volumes of time series data.  TSDB stores data in binary files which are indexed by a timestamp.  Presently TSDB is most suited for SNMP data but it should be easy to add other types of data.

TSDB was initially developed for [ESxSNMP](http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/).
